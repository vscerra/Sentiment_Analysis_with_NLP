    "\n",
    "Now that we have the `logprior` and `loglikelihood`, we can test the naive bayes function by making predictions on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the logistic regression model, we were classifying outcomes as greater or less than 0.5. With the probabilities returned by the Naive Bayes model, a review with a p > 0 is classified as positive, while a review with p < 0 is classified as negative. Just as with the logistic regression model above, the test function for Naive Bayes returns accuracy and F1 score. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Note\n",
    "Note we calculate the prior from the training data, and that the training data is evenly split between positive and negative labels (3727 positive and 3726 negative reviews).  This means that the ratio of positive to negative 1, and the logprior is (nearly) 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of 0.0 means that when we add the logprior to the log likelihood, we're just adding zero to the log likelihood.  However, the logprior is important because whenever the data is not perfectly balanced, the logprior will be a non-zero value.\n",
